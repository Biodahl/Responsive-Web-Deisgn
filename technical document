            <p>The UPS Shipping Department is one of the most profitable areas in the Dexter facility. The service parts ordered through our warranty sales force have the most efficient turnaround and can provide a consistant and repeatable revenue in the most conservative financial quarters.</p>
            <p>Your role is crucial in picking, packing and shipping these orders in an accurate and timely manner to provide our customers with an exceptional customer experience.

            <p>You should already have barcode pick list orders ready to pick in your assigned basket. If not, contact your team leader to get them. Always read through each order when sorting to avoid wasting time looking for a part that may be out of stock. The orders should be sorted according to the ease of the sections where the parts are located:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Parts Super Market Parts - The location code should begin as <code>PSM###</code>. The three numbers following the PSM indicator is the physical section in the cage where the parts will be located.</li>
              <li>Fastenal Parts - This location code will be listed as <code>59000, 6983</code> or the decription of the part will indicate it as a small nut, bolt, washer, etc. (This is one of the reasons to read through the order before picking it.) All of these parts will need a plastic bag witht he part number and quantity written on the bag before shipment.</li>
              <li>Blades - The location code for blades will begin with <code>PSMBLD#</code>. These parts are heavy, so it is recommended that you take a partner to assist you in picking up blades.</li>
              <li>Breaker Parts - The location code for breakers begins <code>BRK###</code>. It is in its own section outside of the main PSM cage. Many of these parts are also heavy and may be in large wooden crates that cannot be opened easily. It is recommended to have a forktruck driver available when finding and moving a breaker part in a crate.</li>
              <li>Kodiac Parts - There are several areas inside and outside of the Dexter facility that contain Kodiac parts. The code will begin as <code>KDK##-####</code>. It is recommended that you have a engineering schematic printed from the EDPM system if you are unfamiliar with the part.</li>
              <li>Location 110000 - The location code <code>110000</code> contains smaller parts that are painted in our facility and delivered to the UPS Shipping Department. Some parts are much too large to store in PSM and are taken to the Highbay for temporary storage. It is best to verify with the team leader where unknown parts may be stored and have a forktruck drive familiar with Highbay locations to retrieve and ship parts stored in Highbay.</li>

            <p>Occasionally, your assigned basket will contain manual pick order lists:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>These are generated by the department manager and will contain past due or HOT orders.</li>
            <li>These orders are considered the highest priority and must be completed the same day they are given to you or a reason must be given why they cannot be completed that day. This ensures our customers are kept in the loop on when they can expect delivery.</li>
            <li><strong>Always</strong> make sure to check with your team leader to verify these orders have not already been shipped out <i>before</i> sorting or picking this type of order.</li>

            <p>Make sure your cart is fully stocked with resealable plastic bags in various sizes, a box cutter, pens and markers, measuring tape and anything else you may need to get your job done accurately and efficiently. Some things to remember:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Restocking - If you take the last part from a location, restock the item. If you can't reach a part, let the forktruck driver know and he will bring the part down for you to stock. If the part cannnot be restocked, write down the part number and location and tell the team leader in PSM/UPS. They can have the part ordered and restocked.</li>
              <li>5S - Cleaning as you go with make your job easier. Break down boxes and put them in the carboard recycling bins. Throw plastic wrap in the green plastic recycling bins. Remove empty pallets from walkways and let the forktruck drivers know so they can be taken to be reused. Empty trash cans as they fill up. </li>
              <li>Motion Bins - Take empty Motion bins to their assigned area as soon as they are empty. Motion is in our facility to restock items we use in large quantities and will restock these bins quickly.</li>
              <li>Frustration - Picking parts can be overwhelming when youu're on a deadline. If you can't find a part within five minutes, move on to another order. It's better to skip the order and ask for help later than to spend thirty minutes looking for a part that is out of stock.</li>
              <li>Take Your Breaks - As important as your job is, it is just as important for you to take your breaks. Your coworkers will thank you for it!</li>

            <p>Check that the packing table is stocked with boxes, padded envelopes and your tape machine has water and is working properly.</p>
            <p>The packing tables are shared, so be mindful of your coworkers. If there are already parts sitting on the table, check to see who is working there before moving anything. Coworkers may have left a partial order to grab another part and it's better to ask than assume someone left a mess to clean up.</p>
            <p>Don't be afraid to ask for an extra pair of hands to help with building larger boxes. Coworkers will always pitch in to help you and expect the same in return.</p>

            <p>The Dexter facility uses the Infor Syteline ERP software and the 3G Pacejet software to process our outgoing orders. It is important for you to complete training on both of these programs to be able to process orders corectly.</p>
            <p>The correct order is as follows and must not be deviated from, unless approved by a team leader in advance:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Is the list a barcode pick order list or a manual pick order list? A manual pick order list must have a barcode pick order list printed out before it can be entered into Syteline.
              <li>Verify the pick list is complete. Are all the items and the number of parts on the order circled? Are the picker's initials on every part on the list? Are there any parts out of stock? Are there additional parts that are not in the package such as a blade? Are there multiple boxes to the order?</li>
              <li>Enter the pick list number into Syteline and tab to the next cell. This will bring up the part number and amount of each part ordered. Any parts that are missing from the order can be entered as zero here.</li>
              <li>After verifying all the information matches the physical list and the computer's information, click the complete button.</li>
              <li>Syteline will bring up a success window and require you to click an ok button to send the order to Pacejet. The shipping order information will not be sent to Pacejet unless this step is completed.</li>
              <li>In Pacejet, pull up the Pacejet Workbench. This will bring up a list of all pending shipping orders for the day. Here's where you'll find the customer shipping information. Click on the small arrow to pull up the rate and ship window.</li>
              <li>Verify the company information matches the pick order list. If there are any issues, do not continue to process the order and get the team leader.</li>
              <li>Enter the size of the package and the weight. If there are multiple packages, each one must have its weight entered individually so a seperate label can be printed and attached to each box. UPS will not take a package without a proper label.</li>
              <li>Click the rate button. The program will automatically pick the type of rate the customer has listed on its account. Any errors in the customer's account with Pacejet will appear at this time. Always get a team leader if an error message appears.</li>
              <li>Click the ship button. A UPS label will print out on the label printer. Place this label on the package.</li>
              <li>Go to the copier/printer and get the packing slips that print out. There are two copies of the same packing slip, one to attach to the package and one for our records.</li>
              <li>Using a clear packing slip envelope, fold the packing slip, insert it into the envelope and attach it to the package. The package is now ready to ship.</li>

          <h3 id="headline">Check out a timeline of his most influential films:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1972</strong> Last House of the Left</li>
            <div>Wes thought this revenge-slasher film would be shown in only a few theatres, so he pushed into more shocking areas of of the genre. The content of the film left him ostracized.</div>
            <li><strong>1977</strong> The Hills Have Eyes</li>
            <div>After failing to get financial back for more conventional films, he wrote this cult classic based of the advice of a friend on how easy it was to film in the Nevada desert.</div>
            <li><strong>1984</strong> A Nightmare on Elm Street</li>
            <div>Considered one of the greatest horror films ever made, Craven's original take on the 80's version of the boogyman cemented his legecy as a horror master.</div>
            <li><strong>1988</strong> The Serpent and the Rainbow</li>
            <div>This voodoo horror movie is based loosely on the non-fiction book of the same name. It's heavy on special effects but more serious in its portrayal of Haitian voodoo practices as a religion.
              <li><strong>1991</strong> The People Under the Stairs</li>
              <div>This commercial hit was Craven's first comedy-horror. His satirical take on gentrification, class-warfare and capitalism hit a home-run with audiences, raking in over $31 million on a $6 million budget</div>
              <li><strong>1994</strong> Wes Craven's New Nightmare</li>
              <div>Although it was considered a failure at the box office, this meta version of his most iconic creation is much closer to what Wes had originally envisioned for Freddy Kruger. The supernatural-slasher is much darker and less comical than the direction the previous films in the Nightmare franchise had taken, resonating with critics.</div>
              <li><strong>1996</strong> Scream</li>
              <div>Wes turned down the offer to direct this script multiple times. But the collaboration of employees, a cancelled project and the failure of his latest horror-comedy renewed his interest. This is <i>the</i> film that reignited interest in the horror genre. It also spawned a franchise that to this day is still blazing trails.</div>
